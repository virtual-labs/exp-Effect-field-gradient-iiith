      "question": "Why does the conductor heat up when there's an electric field applied across it?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Electrons combining with holes",
        "b": "Electrons bumping into the atoms of conductor",
        "c": "Because the conductor's charge equillibrium is distrupted",
        "d": "Both B and C"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "As these electrons move, they constantly collide with the positive ions and other atoms in the conductor. This collision releases heat",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
        "d": "Explanation 2"

      "question": "Semiconductors conduct electricity because?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Atoms have very few valence electrons",
        "b": "The valence band of the atoms is almost completely filled",
        "c": "The valence band of the atoms is partially filled",
        "d": "Both A and C"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The valence band of the atoms is partially filled.If the electrons donâ€™t have enough energy to jump across the band gap, the it does not conduct at all, otherwise it does",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
        "d": "Explanation 2"

    {
      "question": " What is the difference between n-type and p-type semiconductors?",
      "answers": {
        "a": " n_type has valence electrons and p-type has no valence electrons",
        "b": "p_type has valence electrons and n-type has no valence electrons",
        "c": "p-type is electron rich and n-type is hole rich",
        "d": "n-type is electron rich and p-type is hole rich"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "N-type semiconductors are obtained by doping with elements that have more valence electrons. P-type semiconductors are obtained by doping with elements that have fewer valence electrons'",
        "b": "Explanation ",
        "c": "Explanation 2",

    {
      "question": "Why does the charge move from n-type region to p-type region in a diode, even when there's is no applied electric field",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Drift of charge",
        "b": "Diffusion of charge",
        "c": "Diffusion of charge",
        "d": "External environment conditions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "At the junction, some of the free electrons in the n-type wander into the p-type due to diffusion. As they diffuse into the p-type they combine with holes, and cancel each other out.",
        "b": "Explanation 2",
        "c": "Explanation 2",
        "d": "Explanation 2"
