      "question": "1.Why does the conductor heat up when there's an electric field applied across it?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Electrons combining with holes",
        "b": "The electric field causes electrons to stop moving, generating heat",
        "c": " Collisions between electrons and lattice atoms convert electrical energy into heat.",
        "d": "Both B and C"
      },
      "explanation": {
        "As these electrons move, they constantly collide with the positive ions and other atoms in the conductor. This collision releases heat"},
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Extrinsic Semiconductors conduct electricity because?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Atoms have very few valence electrons",
        "b": "The valence band of the atoms is almost completely filled",
        "c": "The valence band of the atoms is partially filled",
        "d": "Both A and C"
      },
      "explanation": {"The valence band of the atoms is partially filled.If the electrons donâ€™t have enough energy to jump across the band gap, the it does not conduct at all, otherwise it does"},
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": " What is the difference between n-type and p-type semiconductors?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "n-type semiconductors have valence electrons as majority charge carriers, while p-type semiconductors have no valence electrons",
        "b": "p-type semiconductors have valence electrons as majority charge carriers, while n-type semiconductors have no valence electrons.",
        "c": "p-type semiconductors are electron-rich with electrons as majority charge carriers, while n-type semiconductors are hole-rich with holes as majority charge carriers.",
        "d": "n-type semiconductors are electron-rich with electrons as majority charge carriers, while p-type semiconductors are hole-rich with holes as majority charge carriers."
      },
      "explanation": { "N-type semiconductors are obtained by doping with elements that have more valence electrons. P-type semiconductors are obtained by doping with elements that have fewer valence electrons"},
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the charge move between n-type region to p-type region in a diode, even when there's is no applied electric field",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Drift of charge",
        "b": "Diffusion of charge",
        "c": " Change in temperature",
        "d": "External environment conditions"
      },
      "explanation": {"At the junction, some of the free electrons in the n-type wander into the p-type due to diffusion. As they diffuse into the p-type they combine with holes, and cancel each other out."},
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "hard"
